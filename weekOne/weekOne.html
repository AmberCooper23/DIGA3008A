            My Experience Setting Up GitHub and Publishing to Pages
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
            Over the holiday, I got more comfortable with GitHub due to my vac work at a web development company. 
            I became accustomed to publishing pages, creating repositories and setting up an index.html file. 
            I did not struggle as much as I did last year, because I was pushed into an environment that required me to either know how to use GitHub or be left behind. 
           <p class="paragraphs"> I definitely see the use of GitHub a lot more than I did before. </p>

            Weekly Readings
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
            This week we explored 'Imagining the Internet'. 
            The readings I selected were The Library of Babel by Jorge Luis Borges, Netscape Navigator History by Matt Blitz as well as Flash and its History on the Web by Jay. 
            Through the readings, I explored the concepts of the infinite library of writing, the browser war and the development of flash.

            This story is about how the narrator lived his life searching for the "catalogue of all catalogues". We read about an infinite library, made up of identical hexagonal galleries. 
            The idea is that you start in one gallery and as life progresses you continue to explore new galleries, in search of the true meaning. 
            <blockquote class="quote">
                "...Everything has meaning because everything can be justified."
            </blockquote>
            Each gallery has identical bookshelves stretching from floor to ceiling, on 4 out of the 6 walls. The books on the bookshelves use 22 letters of the Spanish alphabet, with every possible combination of these symbols being stretched throughout the library, so everything that can be expressed in writing IS expressed. No book is identical, so every book you read will be different from the last. 
            Because it contains all possible combinations of the symbols, for every sensical book there is a nonsensical book, meaning half of the library is just pure nonsense. This drove people crazy searching for meaning in every book; they were met with contradictions, falsities and confusion. But the narrator states that everything has meaning because everything can be justified. The narrator justifies his own search by the idea that there is a book which explains the Library and it's existence, and that there had to be someone out there who had read it. The narrator states that the Library is built by a god, and that is why it is so perfect and how it has always existed. 
            I resonated with the idea that humanity will always suffer by knowing that everything has been written. This is because I often hear people discourage each other by saying, "You're not the first person to come up with that." With the advancement of global relations through the internet, more people are able to share their ideas, so what happens if ideas start running out? Of course, it is natural instinct to evolve, and always find a way to be better, even on a molecular level. So I'm not convinced that we could run out of ideas, but we might rather run out of determination to find new ideas. Even now, as people continue to use AI, we are feeding a database constantly, and are starting to doubt our own capabilities, which has lead to many people becoming so dependent on AI and its tools, rather than finding solutions for themselves. This of course ties to the idea of the dead internet theory, where we see organic human activity being minimised due to the overpopulation of bots on the internet. So what happens when AI doesn't have a solution? Since so many people already consider it to be "all knowing and all growing", where would the motivation to find solutions outside of the database come from?

            Later. Navigator: How Netscape Won and then Lost the World Wide Web by Matt Blitz and Flash and it History on the Web by Jay
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
            I originally had no idea that the browser war was even a thing until I did this reading. Obviously, I knew that the tech industry is highly competitive and that there are constantly sites and apps competing for users, but I didn't know that Microsoft had essentially killed a start up. It was so frustrating to read that these university developers had created something and due to IP rights had to start from scratch, just to be booted by a huge company like Microsoft. I think that if they had taken the deal with Nintendo they might've lasted longer or at least had a fighting chance, but unfortunately it would be at the expense of their ownership. This type of competition is seen all over the internet as it becomes easier for start ups to create and build. The article actually reminded me of something I experienced as a user throughout the years. As Twitter began ruining the user experience, users were moving to apps like BlueSky for example, but that never lasted long, because you had already created an environment for yourself, and its easier to deal with bad user experience than to rebuild your following and algorithms on a new app. This concept is not exclusive to Twitter. As we saw the ban of TikTok in America, many American content creators moved to Xiaohongshu (The Little Red Book), a Chinese social media app, which offered a combined experience of Pinterest, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok. With the move of most creators, many non-Americans found themselves moving over there as well, myself included. This move didn't even last a few days, since TikTok was up and running again quite quickly. The difference between BlueSky and Xiaohongshu though, is that BlueSky was like a brand new platform, whereas Xiaohongshu already had their follower base in China. BlueSky suffered more than Xiaohongshu because of this.

With the drop of internet tools, I of course have to mention Flash. FlashPlayer was a big part of my childhood because it hosted games like Papa's Pizzeria, Friv and Plants vs Zombies. These games made up my childhood, and I remember the moment I opened my browser to play Papa's Pizzeria, only to be greeted with a pop up informing me that Flash was going to be discontinued. For a while after that, it was impossible for me to play these games, because they all relied on FlashPlayer to run. Luckily, a solution was found and the games were back to being up and running.

I think it really says a lot how these different platforms provided what felt like "miniscule" impacts to our daily use, but when you really think about it, you realise how much can actually be lost as both a developer and a user. Going into this industry, I think it's important to be aware of the risks you take with every development you make.

            Goals for this Course
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
            I really enjoyed my web development vac work, and although I know I wasn't working on anything truly important in the grand scheme of things, I hope to do so in the future. Even if it just means making BuzzFeed styled personality quizzes. I also hope to expand my knowledge on digital ethics and how to navigate the world with AI */}
