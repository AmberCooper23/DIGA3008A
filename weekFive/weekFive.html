        <h2 class="postTitle">The Plan</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          As stated in Week 3, my website serves as a place for people to read
          about my experience learning about web development, and follow my
          progress. With this website, I will be building a portfolio for
          myself, outlining my web development capabilities, my essay writing
          and my design. I want the website to feel personal, like a
          conversation. I hope that people will read my blogs and feel like they
          learn about the internet and about me at the same time.
        </p>
        <h2 class="postTitle">Goals for My User</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          My goal is to make a website that can be easily navigated. I don’t
          want the user to feel overwhelmed by the visuals, the context or the
          navigation of the site. This is a place for users to see projects I
          have been a part of, and see my thought process.
        </p>
        <h2 class="postTitle">My User</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I believe there is no way to truly define my user, because you can
          never control who comes across your website. However I can define my
          target audience. My target audience is split into 2 groups; people who
          benefit from my site, people that my site benefits from. People that
          benefit from my site are those who want to see my journey of
          interactive media, and want to learn from my choices. They will mostly
          be interacting with my weekly blogs as well as my Design section. The
          people who my site benefits from are companies, influencers and future
          employers. They will be using my site to see my workflow, my projects,
          my writing and design capabilities. All of these opportunities could
          lead to collaboration, employment and reaching a larger audience.
        </p>
        <h2 class="postTitle">My Content</h2>

        <ul>
          My content is made up of 5 categories:
          <li>Blog</li>
          <li>Design</li>
          <li>Essay</li>
          <li>Portfolio</li>
          <li>About Me</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          The Blog and Design sections are documentation of my journey learning
          web development, and they outline my thought process. The Blog section
          will include some references to academic writing here and there. The
          Essay sections will be essays I write for my Interactive Media course.
          It will be a way for people to see my essay writing skills, as well as
          a chance for me to explore and dive into academic writing. The
          Portfolio section is to showcase and highlight my skills and
          achievements. This will include different sites where you can see my
          work (GitHub, Behance.net and itch.io). The About Me section will
          contain my resume, my social media links, my interests and of course,
          a bio about me!
        </p>
        <h2 class="postTitle">Interface Elements and Information Structure</h2>

        <h3 class="postSubTitle">Input Controls:</h3>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          In my style guide, there is a section for interface. This shows you
          what my buttons look like and my in line hyperlinks. I plan to use
          hover and cursor changes in my css to make it clear that you are
          hovering over a clickable item. The interactive elements will be
          clearly highlighted through use of colours, font styles and shapes.
        </p>
        <h3 class="postSubTitle">Navigational Components</h3>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I have a navigation bar to get you from one page to the next, using
          href links in my html. I also want to utilise breadcrumbs, by
          underlining the active page.
        </p>
        <h3 class="postSubTitle">Informational Components</h3>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I will be using project cards on the Blog homepage so that the user
          sees an image, a quick narrative hook, a title and the date published.
          I do want to have a loader so that while the user is waiting for the
          site to load, there's something nice for them to see.
