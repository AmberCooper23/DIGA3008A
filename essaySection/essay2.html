        <h1 class="p-name">Disconnected: Internet Shutdowns, Digital Colonialism and Repression in Africa. </h1>
        <p class="paragraphs">
In 2024, 50 million Sudanese citizens were cut off from the rest of the world digitally. The internet plays a contradicting role in geopolitics, serving as a tool for empowerment and a medium of control. Through intentional efforts to disrupt digital communications, rendering digital connections inaccessible or unusable. An example of this in African countries, where state actors and political groups have used the internet as a means for repression, censorship and a weapon of war. The record-high number of internet shutdowns in in 2024 reflect the critical intersection between the internet, geopolitics and digital colonialism. Out of 15 countries, Sudan was hit the hardest, suffering the highest financial loss. The record high internet shutdowns in Africa reveal how digital colonialism enables authoritarian regimes, revealing national repression and global inequalities in digital infrastructure and control.
        </p>
<h2 class="headingBackground">Theoretical Framework</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">
    Digital colonialism refers to the digital domination of the Global North and the control it exerts on the Global South. “… Western tech monopolies, with their desire to dominate, control and influence social, political, and cultural discourse, share common characteristics with traditional colonialism,” (Birhane, 2020). Digital colonialism replicates historical colonial relationships through biased information and influence over digital infrastructure, as they have common fundamental desires. The control of communication and infrastructure allows big tech companies to dominate, monitor and influence discourse. The internet shutdowns serve as strong illustrations of digital coloniality as they are used by governments to control and silence the people of a nation by intentionally disrupting their access to networks. We see an increase in the systematic weaponisation of internet access, which closely resembles the weaponisation of education access, where those in power had control over narratives and information.

We see an increase in the systematic weaponisation of internet access, which closely resembles the weaponisation of education access, where those in power had control over narratives and information.
</p>

<p class="paragraphs">
    The silence or complicity of Western tech firms significantly reinforce an imbalance in power dynamics, specifically in the context of internet shutdowns in Africa. Many telecommunications and ISPs are foreign operating companies, meaning they are more inclined to comply with government shutdown orders. Despite their compliance being a result of legal obligations, they are still able to pressure the government rather than enable it. By complying with the orders, and following them blindly, these companies become complicit in human rights violations and encourage the weaponisation of internet access. Through the suppression of domestic content creation, the shutdowns reinforce the dominance of Global North narratives online, silencing indigenous voices whilst praising foreign authority.
</p>
<h2 class="headingBackground">Case Study: Prolonged Shutdowns in Sudan</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">
    In 2023, a civil wore broke out in Sudan between the Sudanese Armed Forced (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Despite over 50 000 people being killed, the media has been comparatively quiet, forcing Sudanese citizens and activists to report the violence. Sudan has a long history of internet shutdowns during political instability. A record of 21 internet shutdowns across 15 African countries were reported 2024, hitting Sudan the hardest. These shutdowns took place during times of political instability, isolating and disconnecting millions of citizens, costing their governments a combined total of $1,56 billion. Sudan alone accounted for $1.12 billion in under 13 000 hours of internet shutdowns, (Abiodun, 2025). Sudan experienced 4 prolonged shutdowns in 2024 implemented by the RSF and SAF, interrupting communication channels. This led to humanitarian efforts and delivery of aid being severely hampered, as well as a control of information. During the shutdowns, popular Sudanese activists were unable to give live updates, eliminating a channel of first-person accounts for the rest of the world. Their shutdowns epitomise how internet control serves as both a war tactic and a postcolonial disconnection strategy, isolating populations and entrenching foreign infrastructure.
</p>
<p class="paragraphs">
 Governments frame the shutdowns as security measures but end up costing their countries millions. An example of this is the rise in protests against the June 2024 Finance Bill which aimed to hike taxes for citizens. Because of this, Kenya experienced their internet disruptions due to social media’s role in mobilising the protests, losing $75 million, (Abiodun, 2025). Internet shutdowns pose a huge threat to human rights as they threaten democracy and leave millions disconnected, (AI, 2025). The blackouts impede freedom of expression and access to information. These internet shutdowns can damage the country’s reputation, forming imbalances in domestic and international relations.
</p>
<p class="paragraphs">
    The shutdowns led to the trending hashtag #KeepItOn started by Access Now – a non-profit organization focuses on internet censorship and human rights – urging an end to the internet shutdowns. The campaign was released in 2016, forming a coalition of about 70 organisations. 
</p>

<h2 class="headingBackground">Human Rights, Resistance, and the Cost of Silence</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">
Internet shutdowns in Africa involve many digital infrastructure components, including Internet Service Providers (ISPs), submarine cables and data centres. These infrastructures were manipulated and disrupted by the various governments using security narratives. 
</p>
<p class="paragraphs">
  ISPs comply with internet shutdowns due to their business arrangements and licensing, making them complicit in the violation of human rights, (Eromo Egbejule, 2025). However, activists and international organisations – such as the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights (ACHPR) have urged ISPs to resist the governments demands and stand for the people, as well as “… Inform users of potential disruptions and exercise due diligence to resolve any disruptions expeditiously,” (African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, 2025).
</p>
<p class="paragraphs">
    Internet shutdowns have served as a tool for repression and censorship in Africa, which significantly impact civic spaces. Through suppression of protests during periods of political unrest, the stifling of freedom of expression and the erosion of public trust and democratic processes, digital activism and online organisation is disrupted, hampering social movements in Africa. 

</p>
<p class="paragraphs">
    Additionally, the shutdowns have directly led to financial losses through disruption of business, impacts on mobile money and uncertainty that deters investments and digital innovation. “Even short-term social media blocking can cause financial hardship for entrepreneurs, small business owners, as well as to large enterprises who rely on social media to connect with their customers,” (Gray, 2025).  Shutdowns disrupt productivity, contributing to unemployment. 
</p>
<p class="paragraphs">
Online spaces are important for organising social movements and internet shutdowns disrupt the ability of citizens to coordinate and engage. This undermines freedom of speech and democratic processes, going directly against human rights. An example of this was in Kenya, where students missed critical exams and online learning, due to Telegram being blocked during national exams. 
</p>
<p class="paragraphs">
    The connection between sovereignty and dependency is crucial in the understanding of digital control in Africa. Governments invoke notions of sovereignty as justification for their actions, whilst the technological landscape creates dependencies which limit the autonomy of the nation and its citizens, (Patrick and Endong, 2022). This dynamic exposes a paradox where African governments claim sovereignty through shutdowns whilst simultaneously relying on foreign-owned infrastructure. 
</p>
<p class="paragraphs">
There is a clear double standard when it comes to internet shutdowns in Global North and the Global South. There is usually vocal outrage from the Western world when places in Iran and Russia experience shutdowns, but little response when it occurs across the African continent. There is an uneven focus of content moderation and digital rights advocacy, meaning platforms are less equipped to understand and moderate harmful content in African languages and contexts. There is a global perception of Africa in the global world, as Africa’s contribution to the technological world is generally seen as “… Responses to famine, drought, disease and death,” (Magenya, 2020). The dominant narrative is that technology in Africa is not used as innovation for fun, pleasure and play. </p>
<h2 class="headingBackground">Conclusion</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">
    The record-high internet shutdowns across Africa in 2024 were not isolated acts of state control but rather factors in a system of digital inequality on global scale and how they are rooted in colonial patterns. This was evident in Sudan, where the intentional silencing of an entire nation during political instability exposed a global need for control and power over human rights. These shutdowns were framed as necessary security measures, but have actually undermined democracy, restricted civic engagement and devastated economies. The complicity of global organisations has also reinforced the double standards that are embedded internationally. #KeepItOn and other resistance movements have become vital voices in the fight for digital equality, but without meaningful shifts in infrastructure, governance and global accountability, African nations will remain trapped in a system where digital connection is a privilege and disconnection a weapon. The future of Africa’s digital landscape must be shaped by the people who depend on it, not by those who benefit from its silence.
