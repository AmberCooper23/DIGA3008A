        <h1 class="p-name">The South African Government Portal does not serve all South Africans fairly and
proves to be inaccessible to many.</h1>
        <p class="paragraphs">
The website I have chosen is the South African Government Portal. It gives you access to
laws, regulations, announcements and public services. Ideally, South Africans across the
world should be able to use the site to get information on social grants, education,
citizenship, driving, etc. The website is meant to cater to all South African citizens,
regardless of circumstance.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraphs">
            If a site is meant to cater to an entire nation, with the population of 63.21 million, all from
different walks of life, then it should be accessible to everyone. This paper aims to evaluate
and analyse the usability and ethical design of the South African Government Portal. It’s
necessary to analyse and investigate the ethical practices of the site’s UI/UX. To further
outline where the website falls flat, I will also be comparing it to the American Government
Portal.
</p>

<h2 class="headingBackground">User Interface (UI) Analysis</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">
    When it comes to visual design, the website is extremely basic, with nearly no images or
icons. I would say the site is functional but extremely inefficient and non-intuitive. The
colours are variants of grey and black, except for the header. The landing page consists of
an Icon and 3 listed points for each navigation card. The layout does not feel overwhelming
to me, but it is frustrating to navigate and use. The navigation bar for example is labelled
“MENU” and when you click down, “Jobs” has a background colour, which implies that we
are currently on the jobs page. Then the rest of the drop-down options under MENU have
their own drop-down options. This feels very badly done, and inefficient. Additionally, there is
no option in the navigation bar to go back to the home page, which again adds to the
navigation difficulty.
</p>
<p class="paragraphs">
    Now if we click on the information cards on the home page, it unlocks a whole new level of
non-intuitive, badly designed layouts. When you click “more” on the site, you are met with a
list of links. This feels so overwhelming to look at, and immediately puts me off using the
website, knowing I will be jumping from link to link. I believe that clearer visual structure
would help ease navigation for users.
</p>

<p class="paragraphs">
    In all honesty, nothing about this site is appealing in general. The layout is boring and non-
intuitive, the grey scale and iconography is dull. Although the font they used is legible, there
is inconsistency in the letter case, for example “Citizens and travel” vs “About Country”. I
believe titles should use capital letters.
</p>
<p class="paragraphs">
    The branding of the site is consistent throughout the site in the header. In the header we can
see the coat of arms, the South African flag, and the colours of the flag on the top margin
outline. However, there could have been more.
</p>

<p class="paragraphs">
    In South African context, only 80% of households have access to a laptop (Africa Check,
n.d.), which means nearly 13 million South Africans rely on a mobile device instead. Even
with many South African households having access to computers, most citizens would
access the internet through mobile devices instead – due to convenience, low digital literacy,
and lack of electricity. However, the government portal does not consider this digital divide
and does not prioritise user experience on mobile. Despite the site still functioning on mobile
devices, the layout becomes difficult to navigate, and visually displeasing. Text and links are
cramped in a list, menus are more of a hassle and their PDFs are not well optimised. If an
elderly person was trying to use the website on their phone, I can guarantee they would click
on the wrong link at least twice before calling for back up. If we consider the dynamics in
classes, people from rural areas or low-income families are likely to rely on their mobile
devices as their digital access point. Unfortunately, with lower class comes poor internet and
limited data. It would be incredibly frustrating and discouraging to have to jump from link to
link, waiting for the page to load each time. It is the portal’s ethical responsibility to be
equally accessible to all users, regardless of their device or connection. It is clear there is a
lack of consideration put into the user and their experience, leading to unfair access to
government services and information.
<h2 class="headingBackground">User Experience (UX) Analysis</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">
    One of the most confusing parts about navigation for me was the number of menus. There is
no need to overwhelm the user with 3 different navigation bars, all with different content.
There could have been much easier way to layout the site, paying extra attention to key
information.
</p>
<p class="paragraphs">
    The site is not user friendly, and the navigation is not intuitive. There are no breadcrumb
Due to the lack of breadcrumb trails, the process and experience is more complicated than it
needs to be. A government portal should make strong attempts at clarity, simplicity and
smooth navigation, but this one does not. Instead, users are met with an overload of
information and hard to understand terminology, making it difficult to pinpoint where the user
needs to go. I believe it would already be much better with a simplified menu of services.
Although there is a search function, it is not very intuitive or efficient on desktop. For
example, I tested it out by searching “Social”. I expected for something related to social
grants to appear, but instead I was met with another list of links, most of which did not have
“social” in the main title. I had to click on “Services” in the filter to see what I was looking for.
However, in mobile, the filter popped up immediately, which nudges the user to filter and
find. Unfortunately, it’s not necessarily obvious that social grants are a service, in the same
way that what the user is looking might be in a category that is not obvious.
The portal has unclear direction, linking back to its poor navigation. Those with little to no
experience with digital platforms are more likely to struggle with navigating the site.
Something as small as paths that guide users through finding the information and services
they need lacks greatly. The site is not user centred, which makes the user rely heavily on
trial and error or external aid. When it comes to ethical design, clear user flow is necessary
to guide users who are relying on the portal to access government services and information.
The portal is full of bureaucratic language and diction and is extremely text-heavy making it
hard to digest for the average user. When you are appealing to an entire nation of different
literacy levels, home languages and vocabulary, you should really prioritise key information
in plain language. In navigating the website, you are expected to go through links upon links,
read through text-heavy pages and PDFs, with no help from the search bar. Although there
is an option to translate the language once you’re on an information page, the translation
does not apply to the entire site, leaving core elements and pages in English, making the
translation a surface level attempt at inclusion.
</p>
<p class="paragraphs">
    The site is not inclusive or accessible to all South Africans. The site does not consider
“[Accessibility and inclusivity] means designing for everybody, keeping in mind the people
who might have some special needs and taking care of those needs in the product
experience and interface,” (GeeksforGeeks, 2024). Inclusive design is one of the main
ethical obligations for a site, especially a government site that is meant to serve and inform
an entire nation. The site is meant to cater to the population, meaning people with
disabilities, the elderly, those with low digital literacy, and those whose home language is not
English. The site makes little to no attempt to do so. Unfortunately, there are no options to
change font size or high contrast. Text heavy content tends to be difficult for people with
visual impairments and reading disabilities. I put the site through accessibilitychecker.org and the audit score is 52%, (Accessibility Checker, n.d.). In the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG) criteria, there are 27 critical issues. The issues are found in interaction
and navigation, screen reader and assistive technology, and visual and structural
accessibility. By failing to recognise and address these features, the site excludes a
significant part of the population, resulting in a digital divide. This means the portal does not
prioritise or acknowledge national usability, disadvantaging people through physical ability,
age and socioeconomic status.
</p>
<p class="paragraphs">
    An amazing feature that the site has is translation, but this is only found at the very bottom of
the page. Meaning a non-English speaker would have struggled reading through the text
heavy page and might have given up before getting to the translation options. South Africa
has so many languages, so a government site that targets ALL South Africans should prompt
you with translation on launch, so the entire experience can happen in a language you
understand. Not to mention, the home page doesn’t even have the translation option. Offline
context ties directly into digital inequalities, as stated in Digital Inequalities and Why They
Matter, “...digital inequality and exclusion cannot be analyzed apart from the offline
circumstances of individuals...” (Robinson et al., 2015). Given the context of South Africa,
translation is so important because of all the South Africans that were not (and are not) given
access to quality education, or education at all. In fact, a lot of elderly South Africans might
have a better chance reading Afrikaans than English due to Bantu Education and the
mandatory use of Afrikaans to teach core studies, (Bauer, 2018). I find it to be a surface level
gesture not a meaningful attempt at inclusivity.
</p>

<h2 class="headingBackground">Compare and Contrast</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">
    A great way to see where we could be doing more ethically is by comparing the South
African Government Portal (gov.za) to the United States of America’s federal site (usa.gov).
Both sites offer the same function – to give their citizens easy access to government
information and services. However, the USA has won the user-centred war. The landing
page was well organised and used colour and icons that felt a bit more thought out. Another
amazing feature they had was the ability to translate to Spanish on every page (located in
the header), leading the user to a full Spanish version of the site, unlike gov.za which only
translated content not the core pages. Additionally, the navigation of usa.gov is a lot
smoother, with clear categories, a fully functional and easy to use search bar, and intuitive
nav bars. These are simple differences that could make a significant difference in the user
experience and would really encourage more South Africans to use the site rather than
visiting the government institutions (i.e: Home Affairs).
</p>
<p class="paragraphs">
    he South African Government Portal is an important tool for citizens to access public
services and information. Although it is functional in the sense that the buttons do what they
are meant to do, and the links lead you to the right places, it is incredibly outdated and there
are barriers to usability. It is unfortunately not friendly for people with low digital literacy, first
time users and older users. The UI and UX are non-intuitive in their complex navigation,
inconvenient search bar, and limited user feedback.
</p>
<p class="paragraphs">
    The site is not user-centred, and the design does not consider the needs of all South
When we look at the ethics of the site, there are too many red flags. The site had a very low
accessibility score, making inaccessible to people with disabilities or visual impairments. The
site was very text heavy and primarily in English, despite the number of languages spoken
by South Africans. This essay evaluated and proved the critical need for ethical UI and UX
design responsibility and illustrated the lack of user consideration in the digital infrastructure. I believe there should be a redesign of the portal, to improve service delivery to every South
African.
