          Below is my style guide. I made it using the Canvas app. I tried to
          capture the colour palette, the typography, the iconography and the
          imagery. I want the images on my site to be minimalist yet artsy. I
          want to try to stick to the sketched look in my pictures, as I feel it
          represents my artsy side.

        Let's outline my interface elements and information structure
      </p>
      <h2>Input Controls:</h2>
      <p class="information">
        In my style guide, there is a section for interface. This shows you what
        my buttons look like and my in line hyperlinks. I plan to use hover and
        cursor changes in my css to make it clear that you are hovering over a
        clickable item. The interactive elements will be clearly highlighted
        through use of colours, font styles and shapes.
      </p>
      <h2>Navigational Components:</h2>
      <p class="information">
        I have a navigation bar to get you from one page to the next, using href
        links in my html. I also want to utilise breadcrumbs, by underlining the
        active page.
      </p>
      <h2>Informational Components:</h2>
      <p class="information">
        I will be using project cards on the Blog homepage so that the user sees
        an image, a quick narrative hook, a title and the date published. I do
        want to have a loader so that while the user is waiting for the site to
        load, theres something nice for them to see.
