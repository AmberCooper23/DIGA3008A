          This is the first wireframe I designed. Because I was already
          experienced in working with Figma, I went right into using Figma
          rather than sketching a wireframe.

          This is the second wireframe I designed. This was a very simple
          design, playing around with a minimalist look. I wasn't a fan of the
          order of the navbar, I feel like "About Me" should be first. I also
          did not like how the active page was shown.

        <h2>My Third Wireframe</h2>
        <p class="p-summary">
          This is the third wireframe I designed. This was done after my style
          guide was done. I really loved the way the nav bar was done, and the
          consistency amongst the different sites. The colours really held well
          together, and the shapes brought back the feeling of minimalism.
