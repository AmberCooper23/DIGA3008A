          <h2 class="postTitle">User Alignment</h2>
          <p class="paragraphs">
            I want users to see an easy to navigate website as soon as it loads.
            I want the colours to be eye catching without being bold or
            overwhelming. This is why I am considering using muted fun colours.
            I want the text and font to be semi-casual and unique, without being
            illegible. I will definitely be using sans serif as it is said to be
            accessible for the most part. I want it to be clear that the website
            is about me, and my experiences. I want the user to be attracted to
            the visual elements, images and typography.
          </p>
          <h2 class="postTitle">User Experience</h2>
          <p class="paragraphs">
            My main focus of my site is the blogs. I want the user to be able to
            navigate freely, but still be nudged to read the blogs.
          </p>
          <h2 class="postTitle">Target Audience</h2>
          <p class="paragraphs">
            I agree that it`s important to know who my user is, in order to
            better market the website. Since the blogs are centred around my
            journey of learning Interactive Media, I want to appeal to others
            like me. I would say my target audience would generally be people in
            their 20s, people who are interested in creating a brand for
            themselves using the internet, and who are also going through the
            journeys of learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I would imagine
            they`d appreciate a sense of relatability and functionality. Being
            able to see what I am learning and how it applies to my website.
            It`s always helpful to have visuals aid text heavy work. The user
            would like to be able to navigate easily between the different
            pages, and be able to see this website on multiple devices. Thus
            meaning it needs to be responsive.
          </p>
          <h2 class="postTitle">My Content</h2>
          <p class="paragraphs">
            As I previously stated, my content is focused on my journey in
            Interactive Media. The most important parts of the content are the
            parts in which I explain how I do things, but the most interesting
            parts would be the visuals as well as the relatability of the blogs.
          </p>
          <h2 class="postTitle">My Figma Design</h2>
          <p class="paragraphs">
            Using Figma, I was able to visualise the flow of my pages and the
            way I want them to look. This was the easiest way for me to map out
            the experience and interface.
