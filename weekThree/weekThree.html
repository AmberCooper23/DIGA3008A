                User Alignment
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraphs">
                I want users to see an easy to navigate website. I want the colours to be eye catching without being bold or overwhelming. I want the text and font to be semi-casual and unique, without being illegible. I want it to be clear that the website is about me, and my experiences. I want the user to be attracted to the visual elements, images and typography.
            </p>
            <h2 class="postTitle">
                User Experience
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraphs"> 
                I want the users to land on the homepage, where they`re given the chance to navigate between the homepage, the blog page and my portfolio. I want the blogs to be the center of attention for the page, because I want the user to interact with it the most. 
            </p>
            <h2 class="postTitle">
                Target Audience
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraphs">
                I agree that it`s important to know who my user is, in order to better market the website. Since the blogs are centred around my journey of learning Interactive Media, I want to appeal to others like me. I would say my target audience would generally be people in their 20s, people who are interested in creating a brand for themselves using the internet, and who are also going through the journeys of learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I would imagine they`d appreciate a sense of relatability and functionality. Being able to see what I am learning and how it applies to my website. It`s always helpful to have visuals aid text heavy work. The user would like to be able to navigate easily between the different pages, and be able to see this website on multiple devices. Thus meaning it needs to be responsive.

                My Content
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraphs">
                As I previously stated, my content is focused on my journey in Interactive Media. The most important parts of the content are the parts in which I explain how I do things, but the most interesting parts would be the visuals as well as the relatability of the blogs.

                My Figma Design
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraphs">
                Using Figma, I was able to visualise the flow of my pages... the way I want them to look. This was the easiest way for me to map out the experience and interface. Hope that it helps.
