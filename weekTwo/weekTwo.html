        <h2 class="postTitle">Folder Structure</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          When it comes to structuring my project folder, I went for a different
          approach. Although I recognise that there might be a correct or better
          way to handle this, I chose to use a structure where I can organise by
          week rather than having a scripts folder. It is for this reason that I
          have chosen to use a folder for images, a folder for styles, and a
          folder for each week. (Right now I have a folder for Week 1 and a
          folder for Week 2).
        </p>
        <h2 class="postTitle">Weekly Readings</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          This week’s reading looks at two perspectives for the future of
          hypertext. One offers a dystopian outlook while the other is more
          optimistic. This is interesting considering that the internet today
          could be viewed in both ways. With the growth of AI, we feel organic
          human communication and interaction feathering away, but we are also
          given the opportunity to connect with people we would have never
          connected with before. The telegram for example, would not have
          connected 2 people from opposite sides of the globe, through a cat
          picture. It’s so important to remember that we have the potential to
          use technology and digital media to challenge power structures in
          society. I think it’s important to question how the future of
          technology will actually change. If we look back to the 20th century,
          people predicted flying care, but now, in the 21st century, I can’t
          combine my Spotify playlists with my Apple Music playlists. I believe
          this speaks to how overambitious and unrealistic humans are. We are
          constantly wanting change and to evolve, yet we still remain under the
          hand of our top 1%. While billionaires profit off of our losses, and
          capitalism grows, we continue to ask for more, without asking to fix
          what we have first.

        <h2 class="postTitle">My Wireframes</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I wanted my site to be simple and easy to navigate. This wireframe
          explores the main structures of the site... Where the title goes, how
          blog is layed out, etc. I don't consider this my final wireframe as I
          do want to later add more and make it a lot more dynamic. I haven't
          tested out the responsiveness of this, so there's a big chance it'll
          change later on so that the display: flex; doesn't have too much of a
          negative impact.

        <h2 class="postTitle">Blog Inspiration</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          <a class="u-url" href=" https://minimalistbaker.com/recipe-index">
            Minimalist Baker Blog
          </a>
          I love the minimalism of the drop downs and search bar just being a
          black outline. The pink is a great pop of colour, rather than a brown
          or red that cooking/baking sites usually adopt. The icons to indicate
          whether the recipes are gluten free, vegan, vegetarian and dairy free
          is quite a nice touch. This is the type of blog that appeals at first
          glance.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a class="u-url" href="https://cupofjo.com"> Cup of Jo Blog </a>
          Again, I love the minimalist look. Although it isn't my plan for my
          blog, it serves as a good reminder to be mindful of my choices. The
          font used is not too formal and not too fun. She uses real life images
          as well as illustrations, which focuses your attention onto that
          specific entry. I like the Most Popular aside, I hope to apply that in
          the future.
