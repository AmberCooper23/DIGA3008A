        <p class="paragraphs">
          When it comes to structuring my project folder, I went for a different
          approach. Although I recognise that there might be a correct or better
          way to handle this, I chose to use a structure where I can organise by
          week rather than having a scripts folder. It is for this reason that I
          have chosen to use a folder for images, a folder for styles, and a
          folder for each week. (Right now I have a folder for Week 1 and a
          folder for Week 2).

        <h2 class="postTitle">Weekly Readings</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          This week’s reading looks at two perspectives for the future of
          hypertext. One offers a dystopian outlook while the other is more
          optimistic. This is interesting considering that the internet today
          could be viewed in both ways. With the growth of AI, we feel organic
          human communication and interaction feathering away, but we are also
          given the opportunity to connect with people we would have never
          connected with before. The telegram for example, would not have
          connected 2 people from opposite sides of the globe, through a cat
          picture. It’s so important to remember that we have the potential to
          use technology and digital media to challenge power structures in
          society. I think it’s important to question how the future of
          technology will actually change. If we look back to the 20th century,
          people predicted flying care, but now, in the 21st century, I can’t
          combine my Spotify playlists with my Apple Music playlists. It's small
          improvements like these that impact your regular audience, which is
          extremely important. Learning about hyperlinks has really made me
          realise how much we, as creators, focus on the convenience of the
          user. I believe this speaks to how overambitious and unrealistic
          humans are. We are constantly wanting change and to evolve, yet we
          still remain under the hand of our top 1%. While billionaires profit
          off of our losses, and capitalism grows, we continue to ask for more,
          without asking to fix what we have first.

        <h2 class="postTitle">My Wireframes</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I wanted my site to be simple and easy to navigate. This wireframe
          explores the main structures of the site... Where the title goes, how
          blog is layed out, etc. I don't consider this my final wireframe as I
          do want to later add more and make it a lot more dynamic. I haven't
          tested out the responsiveness of this, so there's a big chance it'll
          change later on so that the display: flex; doesn't have too much of a
          negative impact.

          <figcaption>Basic wireframe for the Website</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          Generally, wireframes are just comprised of simple shapes, but I
          struggle a lot to visualise that way. I chose to use Figma so I could
          really understand what I wanted the website to look like. I don't
          think having a bit more of a complex wireframe that has colours and
          images would affect my design process negatively. One of my biggest
          beliefs about design is that you should do what makes sense to the
          person using the design. In this case, me.

        <h2 class="postTitle">Blog Inspiration</h2>
        <p class="p-summary">
          I found a few blogs that really caught my eye in their own ways, and
          have chosen to use them as inspiration.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          <a class="u-url" href=" https://minimalistbaker.com/recipe-index">
            Minimalist Baker Blog
          </a>
          Minimalist Baker is an online recipe book filled with simple recipes.
          I love the minimalism of the drop downs and search bar just being a
          black outline. The pink is a great pop of colour, rather than a brown
          or red that cooking/baking sites usually adopt. The icons to indicate
          whether the recipes are gluten free, vegan, vegetarian and dairy free
          is quite a nice touch. This is the type of blog that appeals at first
          glance. I like that blogs can do well without having a face attached
          to it, especially since I am hoping to avoid putting my face on the
          website for now. The target audience is very clear, which also
          prevents people from feeling like the site is useless. I feel like the
          communication in interaction between the user and the creator is
          really well done.

          <a class="u-url" href="https://cupofjo.com"> Cup of Jo Blog </a>
          This blog is written by a woman named Joanna, talking about her daily
          life. The blog focuses on culture, food, travel, relationships and
          parenting. I love how personal the entries feel, as if you're talking
          to Joanna personally. Again, I love the minimalist look. Although it
          isn't my plan for my blog, it serves as a good reminder to be mindful
          of my choices. The font used is not too formal and not too fun. She
          uses real life images as well as illustrations, which focuses your
          attention onto that specific entry. I like the Most Popular aside, I
          hope to apply that in the future. I really appreciate the word play of
          the blog name because I also used word play for my site.
