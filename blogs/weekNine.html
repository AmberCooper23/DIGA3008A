        <h2 class="postTitle">What is digital equality? An interview with Nanjira Sambuli</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          Digital equality: “…dissecting the analogue and the digital aspects of political, social, cultural, economic dimensions in society today, and ultimately striving to ensure that we do not widen inequalities through digital technologies,” (Nanjira).
        </p>

        <p>
         Digital equality means ensuring everyone – regardless of circumstances – has equal access to, as well as opportunities to use and benefit from the digital world. This means acknowledging the cultural, socio-political and economical systems. As Nanjira Sambuli says, we have to be careful that we don’t allow digital technology to add onto and widen these inequalities.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          Only half of the world is online, because there is no effort in making the internet and connecting devices in the market.

Factors that contribute to who gets access to internet and its benefits:

Gendered inequalities
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
Inequalities between and within geographies
          </li>
          <li>
Gendered inequalities
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="paragraphs">
    We need to dig deeper and counter analogue inequalities and figure out how to use technology to break these inequalities.
Digital inequality is also a policy issue. Clear plans need to be put in place to handle complicated societal problems.

Civil society plays a key role in shaping how technology affects communities and have been pushing against the idea that technology is always THE answer. They are first in line to point out digital divide and inequalities. Risks and harms like environmental impacts and digital divides have been highlighted. Civil society should be proactive more than reactive, meaning they should be putting effort into making technology inclusive and equal. We need technology that uplifts, but we currently have technology that excludes.

        <h2 class="postTitle">Digital Inclusion by Cheptoo Kositany-Buckner</h3>
<blockquote class="quote">
  Digital Inclusion – ability for individuals to access and use information and communication technologies.
</blockquote>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          Digital Exclusion leads to poverty and marginalisation.

Africa is greatly excluded from the digital world (by over 70% of the continent being without internet access).

Without universal access to technology, the digital divide keeps getting worse, resulting in increased inequality and disadvantages of marginalised groups.

Nearly half the world population does not have access to the internet (UN International Telecommunication Union stated in 2019).

Intersectionality needs to be acknowledged in digital divide, due to the interplay of socio-economic status when it comes to race, age, region, sexual orientation, gender, etc.

Rural areas would offer a lot of diversity in the online market and discussions due to local products, customs and languages. However, they are isolated in the physical and therefore digital world (“Rural Penalty”).

        <p class="paragraphs">
          Design has a significant impact on our lives but not everyone participates in the design process.

Design justice defined by a community:
<ol>
  <li>
    "Designing with instead of for."
  </li>
  <li>
    "Creating systems that build on the brilliance of those most affected."
  </li>
  <li>
    "Complicated and requires humility."
  </li>
  <li>
    "Planning done by the community, for the community."
  </li>
</ol>
        </p>
        
        <p class="paragraphs">
         Design Justice is a collaborative effort to ensure design is inclusive and acknowledge those affected by the design, be it the consumers or the inspiration. Design justice should challenge status quo, include equitable processes and result in equitable outcomes.

        <h2 class="postTitle">Design Justice Community Led Practices to Build (Constanza Chock 2020)</h3>
      
        <p class="paragraphs">
         “It is a truism that in a democracy, every citizen should have the opportunity to take part in decision making about what we do, how we operate, how we structure the world we live,” (Sandra Braman, 2020).

The main ideas of this reading is that democracy requires the community to lead decisions, especially when it comes to how society operates.
