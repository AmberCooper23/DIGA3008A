For many of us, our first (and sometimes only) impressions of a country come from the results of a search engine. However, a lot of countries are not afforded the same infrastructure and digital architecture as others, leading to an uprising of non-local search engine results in countries that are not well-connected in the digital world.        </p>

        <p>
        As seen in the below diagram, well-connected countries (Western) rely less on search engines from other countries. Whereas poorly-connected countries depend on a variety of search engine origins.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../images/map.png"
            alt="Diversity of Search Engines"
            class="u-photo, figure"
          />
        <p class="paragraphs">
         This tells us that the well-connected countries push more local content, whereas poorly-connected countries take in more non-local content. We see this in our everyday life where we consume American media and news much more than we consume South African media and news. For many, they don't see South African content as being high quality, whereas American content is. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="paragraphs">
          The reading I have chosen for Week 10 is Digital Hegemonies: The Localness of Search Engine Results. This reading investigated the diversity in the search engine, and compares the locality of different searches.
        </p>

        <h2 class="postTitle">Why are some countries denied locally produced representation and how do we bring more local participation in the digital augmentation of poorly connected countries?</h2>
        
        <p class="paragraphs">
According to the figures provided, we see more content produced by well-connected and wealthy countries. We see most searches being tied back to the US, implying that the digital world and its information revolves around the Western World. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraphs">
Most countries in the Global South are defined by a variety of sources from a variety of regions. However, we see a bias in these sources, whereby the Global North acts as the hub of all sources.         </p>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          Socio-economic systems that are able to produce high quality research tend to also produce highly visible content. It's clear that the criteria for scientific research (as a basis of who gets to produce content) is qualitative not quantitative. However, if we look at socioeconomic context, this is unfair. Countries in the Global South are much more limited with their resources due to the Global Norths oppressive history. The Global North can maintain it's hegemony (dominance) in the academic world by continuing to profitise off of the Global South whilst limiting their resources, isolating them from the evolving world. It is like expecting a child to read, but locking them in a room alone. How could you accomplish a goal when you are kept away from what you need to reach it?
