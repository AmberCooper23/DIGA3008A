        <h2 class="postTitle">My Journey with HTML Structure</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          As previously mentioned, I do have some experience with HTML structure
          from doing vacation work at a web development company. For the most
          part, I already knew how to set up the HTML and I already understood
          semantic markup. What was new for me however was the microformatting
          and metadata. It was the first time I had heard of either of them. We
          did not use either of those at the company, so I had to figure that
          out. This did not take too long for me to wrap my head around, as I
          already used classes for my HTML, so it was just a matter of replacing
          certain class names with the correct micro formats and adding the meta
          data. One of the hardest parts of building this website was linking to
          other HTML files. At first, I kept getting 404 errors, but once I took
          my time to do things properly, it worked out.
        </p>

        <h2 class="postTitle">Interactive Design Process</h2>
        <h3 class="postSubTitle">User Needs</h3>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          User needs refers to desires, goals, and expectations. I had to make
          sure my site had full functionality. I also made use of alt text and
          did my research on ARIA for accessibility. I wanted all users to be
          able to interact with my work, regardless of their circumstances. I
          want it to be as user friendly as possible. In order to do this, I
          have to make sure I am doing enough research about user needs and user
          diversity. Accessible websites make use of colours that contrast well,
          alt texts and ARIA. However, I have yet to play around fully with
          ARIA.
        </p>

        <h3 class="postSubTitle">Defining and Developing Framework</h3>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          Framework refers to the structure of the pages. I made sure that my
          structure guided the user through grouping. I found that having
          relative elements together helped establish the relationships between
          sections, and nudged the user to follow the flow of the content. As I
          said, I have already played with css and styling. So I have seen the
          smoothness between the different pages and interactions. It works
          really well and I am so excited to begin styling and working with
          JavaScript.
        </p>

        <h3 class="postSubTitle">Refining the Experience</h3>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          When it comes to refining my experience, I changed my wireframes a
          lot. I really adopted the concept of not being attached to my
          wireframes. My vision changed as I exposed myself more and more to
          different websites, so my wireframes would then adapt to that. I
          believe that from my first wireframe to my next wireframe, the
          experience has been refined. You can see how I realised how your
          structure and layout impacts the way the user interacts with the
          content.
        </p>

        <h2 class="postTitle">My Accomplishments</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          My website looked exactly how I wanted it to look, and I was very
          proud of this. However, I had set up my css and was told to comment
          out my css references because it wasn’t needed yet. This was a bit
          frustrating for me at times, because it felt like I was ahead of the
          class but I wasn’t able to just keep going.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraphs">
          I really loved how I integrated my images into the text. I felt like
          it really helped break up the heaviness of the text. I also used my
          headers to break up a lot of the text, and I used blockquotes to
          regrab the user's attention when I felt the content was not as
          interesting. I was really worried because my blogs were so text heavy,
          so I’m glad I managed to break it up.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraphs">
          I also really like the way my folders were organized. I’m glad I went
          with what makes sense to me, rather than what was advised. It made my
          referencing and finding files a lot easier. This helped me create
          clear routing and pathways for my href paths.
        </p>

        <h2 class="postTitle">Future Changes</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          Scrolling is tedious, and I really wanted to avoid it. In future, I
          would really like to add an aside, so that the user can jump to the
          header they click on. I feel like when your content is full of so many
          different aspects, and is not necessarily linear, the feeling of
          scrolling and scanning can feel inconvenient. I actually took this
          idea from Wikipedia, because I use their hyperlink function so much.
