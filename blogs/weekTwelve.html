            Welcome to Week 12 of Interactive Media! This week I'll be focusing
            on code and decoloniality.

        <p class="paragraphs">
When discussing code and decoloniality, we recognise that technology is built around biases and power structures, often centralising those who created them. For my website, I really want to be intentional in my design on all angles. I want my site to be accessible and inclusive. As a woman of colour, I know what it’s like to be underrepresented, so I want to prevent any of my target audience from feeling like that. I will be mindful of my language choices, my visual design and my readability. When it comes to JavaScript though, it’s a bit more different.        </p>

        <p>
          "Select a South African website or a website offering services in
          South Africa that interests you. Using the readings and lectures as a
          starting point, present a detailed analysis of the UI and UX and
          deliberate on the ethics of the interaction design."
        </p>
        <p class="paragraphs">
At first, my website was static since I only used HTML and CSS. It was responsive, but it could be improved. I also feel like the base navigation was there, but because of the long-formed blogs, it could be a lot better. This is where JavaScript comes in.        </p>
        
        <h2 class="postTitle">Changes I want to Make:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
Jump to Top Button so the user doesn’t have to scroll up after reading through a whole blog, as those are very long.         </li>
          <li>
Hamburger Menu to toggle the visibility of the nav bar when using a mobile device.          </li>
          <li>
Sticky Nav Bar so the nav bar remains visible when the user scrolls down, just allows for quick navigation. 
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="postTitle">Impact on Iterative Design</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          The goal is to make interactions with my site feel natural, intuitive and responsive. I want to avoid the reader getting frustrated as much as possible.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I want to make sure that the user can navigate my site easily and
          quickly. I want to make sure that the user can find what they are
          looking for without having to search for it. I want to make sure that
          the user can interact with my site in a way that feels natural and
          intuitive.
