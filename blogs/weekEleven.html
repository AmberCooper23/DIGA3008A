            Welcome to Week 11 of Interactive Media! This week I'm looking at the article "Making a Feminist Internet in Africa: Why the Internet Needs African Feminists and Feminisms" by Sheena Magenya. 
          </blockquote>
        </section>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          Magenya offers a critique on the illusion that the internet automatically provides a level field of equal access and representation, emphasising how the digital world just replicates offline inequalities. She explains there is a need for African feminists, to guide the diverse experiences and realities that are reflected on the internet. 
        </p>

        <p>
          There is a romanticisation of the internet, where the Western world sees the internet as a means for global equality. This is, unfortunately, a myth. The truth is, being online only offers certain demographics a platform. As Magenya highlights, many African women and queer individuals are not given the same platform, and are often times attacked for it. This is why it's important to have African feminists on the internet, as they offer alternative narratives and are well aware of intersectionality. As Magenya says, "African feminists make more room for African women online."
        </p>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I think it's important to understand that African feminism is somewhat of an antonym to white feminism. White feminism is when white women advocate for issues that are specific and generally exclusive to them. This entirely ignores the non-Western world, and avoids the concept of intersectionality in feminism. White feminism often pushes the narrative of equality, rather than equity. Equity ensures that people are given equal and fair access to resources, whereas equality ensures that people are given the same resources, often times ignoring circumstances that prevent fair access and use. Throughout history, white feminism has excluded people of colour and queer individuals, as it often uses the image of white women as the standard, ignoring the different positions other individuals might be in.

        <p class="paragraphs">
          I believe there needs to be a reorientation in how the media sees African feminist engagement. I believe it needs to shift from being supplementary to being foundational. As someone who already engages a lot with African feminism digitally, I do believe that I am a lot more represented there than anywhere else. I think it would really open the digital representation up to intersectionality, and kill the need for "white feminism".
