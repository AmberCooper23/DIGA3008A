          The Essay Brief

          It's important to refer back to the brief when writing essays, so let's look at what's expected from this assignment.

          "Select a South African website or a website offering services in South Africa that interests you. Using the readings and lectures as a starting point, present a detailed analysis of the UI and UX and deliberate on the ethics of the interaction design."

          Websites that Interest Me
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I wanted to take a look at websites that appeal to younger demographics, as they tend to be more creative and immersive.

          Skate Shack
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          The first site that peaked my interest was Skate Shack. Skate Shack is a South African owned skate shop, where customers can purchase all things skateboards, as well as merch. You are given the option to purchase a skateboard, or build one yourself, which I love. The site is minimalist, whilst still including some well taken snaps of the skate life at dawn. unfortunately, there are aspects of the site that feel incomplete, and unprofessional.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraphs">
          Let's talk about it!
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">
          Landing Page
        </h3>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../images/skateShack 1.png"
            alt="Skate Shack Landing Page"
            class="u-photo, figure"
          />
          <figcaption>Skate Shack Landing Page</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          What I liked about this page is the background image with text ontop of it. The text colours contrast well with the image, which is important for readability. Another pro is how easy the site is to use. From the nav bar to the search bar, navigation is so convenient. The user doesnn't feel overwhelmed with information, and the layout is simple yet eye-catching.  
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">
          Store and Merch Section
        </h3>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../images/skateShack2.png"
            alt="Skate Shack Store Front"
            class="u-photo, figure"
          />
          <figcaption>Skate Shack Store and Merch Section</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          When you scroll down on the landing page, you see the store categories and the merch. I liked how minimalist this section is. The product category icons are simple, and the merch icons are interesting. I do feel like they should have been consistent in the iconography of the site. If they used the same look of the Merch products icons, the website would work really well together, and everything would tie in. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">
          The Merch
        </h3>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../images/skateShack3.png"
            alt="Skate Shack Merch Section"
            class="u-photo, figure"
          />
          <figcaption>Skate Shack Merch</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="paragraphs">
I found the layout and look of the items to be really interesting, but it also quite overwhelming. They should have just organised the clothes by type of item, and allowed the customer to change the colour in their cart. Additionally, as seen in the image above, the one pair of white socks are the only item that have a grey background. Another inconsistency is the way some items have hover animations, while others don't.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">
          The Footer
        </h3>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../images/skateShack4.png"
            alt="Skate Shack Footer"
            class="u-photo, figure"
          />
          <figcaption>Skate Shack Footer</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="paragraphs">
I felt like the footer looked unfinished and too minimal. There are no hover effects on the quick links, except for the cursor changing to pointer. There is no indication of what is or isn't clickable. I feel like the site doesn't communicate well to the user because of this.
