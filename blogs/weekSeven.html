            Welcome to Week 7 of Interactive Media! This week I'll be focusing

          It's important to refer back to the brief when writing essays, so
          let's look at what's expected from this assignment.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Select a South African website or a website offering services in
          South Africa that interests you. Using the readings and lectures as a
          starting point, present a detailed analysis of the UI and UX and
          deliberate on the ethics of the interaction design."
        </p>
        <h2 class="postTitle">Websites that Interest Me</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I wanted to take a look at websites that appeal to younger
          demographics, as they tend to be more creative and immersive.
        </p>
        <ol>

        </ol>
        <h2 class="postTitle">Skate Shack</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          The first site that peaked my interest was Skate Shack. Skate Shack is
          a South African owned skate shop, where customers can purchase all
          things skateboards, as well as merch. You are given the option to
          purchase a skateboard, or build one yourself, which I love. The site
          is minimalist, whilst still including some well taken snaps of the
          skate life at dawn. Unfortunately, there are aspects of the site that
          feel incomplete, and unprofessional.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraphs">Let's talk about it!</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Landing Page</h3>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../images/skateShack 1.png"
            alt="Skate Shack Landing Page"
            class="u-photo, figure"
          />
          <figcaption>Skate Shack Landing Page</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          What I liked about this page is the background image with text ontop
          of it. The text colours contrast well with the image, which is
          important for readability. Another pro is how easy the site is to use.
          From the nav bar to the search bar, navigation is so convenient. The
          user doesnn't feel overwhelmed with information, and the layout is
          simple yet eye-catching.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Store and Merch Section</h3>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../images/skateShack2.png"
            alt="Skate Shack Store Front"
            class="u-photo, figure"
          />
          <figcaption>Skate Shack Store and Merch Section</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          When you scroll down on the landing page, you see the store categories
          and the merch. I liked how minimalist this section is. The product
          category icons are simple, and the merch icons are interesting. I do
          feel like they should have been consistent in the iconography of the
          site. If they used the same look of the Merch products icons, the
          website would work really well together, and everything would tie in.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">The Merch</h3>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../images/skateShack3.png"
            alt="Skate Shack Merch Section"
            class="u-photo, figure"
          />
          <figcaption>Skate Shack Merch</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I found the layout and look of the items to be really interesting, but
          it also quite overwhelming. They should have just organised the
          clothes by type of item, and allowed the customer to change the colour
          in their cart. Additionally, as seen in the image above, the one pair
          of white socks are the only item that have a grey background. Another
          inconsistency is the way some items have hover animations, while
          others don't.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">The Footer</h3>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../images/skateShackFooter.png"
            alt="Skate Shack Footer"
            class="u-photo, figure"
          />
          <figcaption>Skate Shack Footer</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I felt like the footer looked unfinished and too minimal. There are no
          hover effects on the quick links, except for the cursor changing to
          pointer. There is no indication of what is or isn't clickable. I feel
          like the site doesn't communicate well to the user because of this.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">The Store Front</h3>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../images/skateShackStore.png"
            alt="Skate Shack Store"
            class="u-photo, figure"
          />
          <figcaption>Skate Shack Store</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          As the image shows, the store uses the same iconography that the merch
          store uses. However, I feel like they should have organised this a lot
          better. It is extremely hard to navigate an unorganised store front.
          Again, there is inconsistency with the hover animations, they don't
          all have them.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Summary</h3>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          Overall, I found this website's UI and UX to be very overwhelming and
          unorganised. They had so many cool features, but because of the
          inconsistencies, it felt so unfinished and chaotic.
        </p>

        <h2 class="postTitle">Becoming You</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          Next, I have Becoming You. The site is run by a South African who
          wants to share her travel tips and suggestions with the world. This
          site is filled with beautiful imagery, whilst still keeping a very
          simplistic style.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Landing Page</h3>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../images/becomingYou1.png"
            alt="Becoming You Landing Page"
            class="u-photo, figure"
          />
          <figcaption>Becoming You Landing Page</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I absolutely love this website's landing page. The pictures loop,
          which was so visually pleasing. The navbar is very minimalist which i
          quite like. The only downfall for me is the colour contrast of the
          baby pink text and the white background.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">The Sidebar</h3>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../images/becomingYou2.png"
            alt="Becomiing You Sidebar"
            class="u-photo, figure"
          />
          <figcaption>Becomiing You Sidebar</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I absolutely love how organised this website is, and having the
          sidebar for popular posts AND categories really adds to the ease of
          navigation. I can understand that having so many points for navigation
          might be too much, but I personally love it. I also love the subtle
          use of colour, this website is so good at tying everything back in
          again.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Featured Posts</h3>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../images/becomingYou3.png"
            alt="Becoming You Featured Posts"
            class="u-photo, figure"
          />
          <figcaption>Becoming You Featured Posts</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I love the consistency of the thumbnail pictures. They really pull the
          user in, which is so important. My favourite part about these blog
          cards is the information given by the text. You are told the
          categories, the title, the writer, the date published and a short
          narrative hook.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">The Footer</h3>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../images/becomingYouFooter.png"
            alt="Becoming You Footer"
            class="u-photo, figure"
          />
          <figcaption>Becoming You Footer</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          My favourite part of the footer is the arrow. When a site has a lot of
          content, it's nice to have a "back to the top" feature. This is yet
          another feature that contributes to the easy navigation of the site.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Summary</h3>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          Between Skate Shack and Becoming You, Becoming You is my favourite
          site. I feel like it was so easy to navigate, so consistent with
          imagery, and maintaining the same minimalist structure. I do think it
          needs improvement with colour contrast, but it's really amazing how
          well everything tied together.
