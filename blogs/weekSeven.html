          The Essay Brief
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          It's important to refer back to the brief when writing essays, so let's look at what's expected from this assignment.
          </p>

        <p>
          "Select a South African website or a website offering services in South Africa that interests you. Using the readings and lectures as a starting point, present a detailed analysis of the UI and UX and deliberate on the ethics of the interaction design."

          Websites that Interest Me
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I wanted to take a look at websites that appeal to younger demographics, as they tend to be more creative and immersive.
        </p>
        

        <h2 class="postTitle">
          Skate Shack
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          The first site that peaked my interest was Skate Shack. Skate Shack is a South African owned skate shop, where customers can purchase all things skateboards, as well as merch. You are given the option to purchase a skateboard, or build one yourself, which I love. The site is minimalist, whilst still including some well taken snaps of the skate life at dawn. unfortunately, there are aspects of the site that feel incomplete, and unprofessional.
