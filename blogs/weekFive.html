            Welcome to Week 7 of Interactive Media! For this section, I will be
            diving into design.
          </blockquote>
        </section>
        <h2 class="postTitle">The Plan</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          As stated in Week 3's blog, my website serves as a place for people to
          read about my experience learning about web development, and follow my
          progress. With this website, I will be building a portfolio for
          myself, outlining my web development capabilities, my essay writing
          and my design. I want the website to feel personal, like a
          conversation. I hope that people will read my blogs and feel like they
          learn about the internet and about me at the same time. I wanted to
          communicate through round shapes and fun tertiary colours that I am a
          bubbly and fun person. I feel like my use of rounded shapes also show
          that I'm young (and therefore still learning).
        </p>
        <h2 class="postTitle">Goals for My User</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          My goal is to make a website that can be easily navigated. I don’t
          want the user to feel overwhelmed by the visuals, the context or the
          navigation of the site. I plan to use a constant nav bar that the user
          can utilise on every page. I also make use of page headings, which
          remind the user of where they are on my side. This is a place for
          users to see projects I have been a part of, and see my thought
          process.
        </p>
        <h2 class="postTitle">My User</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I believe there is no way to truly define my user, because you can
          never control who comes across your website. However I can define my
          target audience. My target audience is split into 2 groups; people who
          benefit from my site, people that my site benefits from. People that
          benefit from my site are those who want to see my journey of
          interactive media, and want to learn from my choices. They will mostly
          be interacting with my weekly blogs as well as my Design section. The
          people who my site benefits from are companies, influencers and future
          employers. They will be using my site to see my workflow, my projects,
          my writing and design capabilities. All of these opportunities could
          lead to collaboration, employment and reaching a larger audience.
        </p>
        <h2 class="postTitle">My Content</h2>

        <ul>
          My content is made up of 5 categories:
          <li>Blog</li>
          <li>Design</li>
          <li>Essay</li>
          <li>Portfolio</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          The Blog and Design sections are documentation of my journey learning
          web development, and they outline my thought process. The Blog section
          will include some references to academic writing here and there. The
          Essay sections will be essays I write for my Interactive Media course.
          It will be a way for people to see my essay writing skills, as well as
          a chance for me to explore and dive into academic writing. The
          Portfolio section is to showcase and highlight my skills and
          achievements. This features my art portfolios, my writing, my games,
          my game assets and maybe some websites I have worked on in my own
          time. The Portfolio section will also contain cv, a way to contact me,
          my interests and of course, a quick bio about me!

        <h2 class="postTitle">Interface Elements and Information Structure</h2>

          />
          <figcaption>My Style Guide</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3 class="postSubTitle">Input Controls:</h3>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          In my style guide, there is a section for interface. This shows you
          what my buttons look like and my in line hyperlinks. I plan to use
          hover and cursor changes in my css to make it clear that you are
          hovering over a clickable item. The interactive elements will be
          clearly highlighted through use of colours, font styles and shapes. I
          wanted my hyperlinks to stand out, so I made their text purple. As for
          my nav bar, I used hover to temporarily show the button UI, and used
          active to indicate what page the user is on. Details like this are
          important, as they communicate with the user and encourage
          interaction.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I chose a font that was rounded, whilst still remaining legible and
          neat. I believe that communicating playfulness in my site is a great
          way to hook users. When it comes to font sizes, I was very careful not
          to use anything that was too small or too big. There is a spectrum
          that goes from illegible to in your face, and I wanted to maintain a
          perfect middle.
        </p>
        <h3 class="postSubTitle">Navigational Components</h3>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I have a navigation bar to get you from one page to the next, using
          href links in my html. I also want to utilise breadcrumbs, by
          highlighting the active page.
        </p>
        <h3 class="postSubTitle">Informational Components</h3>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I will be using project cards on the Blog homepage and the Design
          homepage so that the user sees an image, a title and the date
          published. Because my target audience is people interested in web
          development, I believe the best way to hook them is through consistent
          visuals. I chose one theme and stuck to it. I do want to have a loader
          so that while the user is waiting for the site to load, there's
          something nice for them to see. I also ensured that there is alt text
          for every image, to ensure that users with screen readers are able to
          use my website in full functionality. I tried my best to ensure that
          my colour contrasting was good, making sure there was no light on
          light or dark on dark overlays.
